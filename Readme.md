# Not 200 Club

Hey!

This script takes a xlsx file from the target folder, (if the folder doesn't exist you will have to create it) it has to be the only file in the target folder.
the xlsx file can be named anything, but needs to be formatted in a very specific way. Shown as follows:
Seeker Name, Coach, URL

It will outout to a folder called res, if there is no res folder the script will create one.
The script will have to complete before it creates the output file.

The script is very finicky as right now, but we can update this if need be.
